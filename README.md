This programming assignment is to develop an Enigma machine that Germany navy used during World War II to encrypt its military communications. The Enigmas contains couple rotors and used a progressive substitution cipher on letters of message to perform a one-to-one permutation for each rotor. 
	Independently implemented all the rotors from an Object-based programming perspective and used couple basic data structures as multidimensional arrays, linked list, and ArrayList. 
	Wrote 100 lines of unit tests for each rotor and added my own integration tests. The project is fully functional for 26 letters of one-to-one encryption and decryption and contains couple exceptions class handling configuration errors.
